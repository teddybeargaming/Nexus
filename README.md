OK, this is a simple Nexus 3D demo.
In case anyone was wondering what Nexus is, it's basically an open-source game engine I made using C, C#(the essential languages you need to have a knowledge of), HTML (for the web), C++(for Win/Win64 games),Swift (for OS X games) & OpenGL.
For devs (like me lol) who want to make a game using Nexus, pls visit this website- http://nexus.dev
