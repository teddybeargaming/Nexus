This is a simple Nexus 3D demo. In case anyone was wondering what Nexus is, it's basically an open-source game engine I made using C & C#. For devs (like me lol) who want to make a game using Nexus, pls visit this website- https://nexus.dev
Licenced under the Apache 2.0 licence, pls read the LICENCE.md file for it.
Download Visual Studio Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
  Windows users, you can also find Visual Studio Code on the Microsoft Store. NOTE- THE SOURCE IS BROKEN, PLEASE DOWNLOAD FROM RELEASE!
